# Starter Online Shopping App with Oracle APEX

## Overview
This project is based on the Oracle LiveLabs workshop where I built a shopping cart application using Oracle APEX. The app demonstrates how low-code development can quickly deliver a functional e-commerce solution.

## Features
- Admin pages to manage products, customers, and stores
- Customer pages to browse products and add to cart
- Checkout workflow for placing orders
- Interactive reports and forms built with APEX low-code features

## How to Run
1. Import the SQL scripts into Oracle APEX SQL Workshop.
2. Import the APEX app export file into your workspace.
3. Run the app to explore admin and customer features.
